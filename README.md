# Advanced Anti-Detection Injection System

This project implements sophisticated stealth injection techniques designed to avoid common detection methods used by anti-cheat systems and security monitoring tools. The system employs multiple layers of evasion techniques for educational cybersecurity research.

## üîí Core Anti-Detection Features

### **1. Multi-Target Manual Injection**
- **Dual process support**: Automatically detects and injects into either `Project Epoch.exe` or `ascension.exe`
- **Manual timing control**: User initiates injection when ready (simplified - no world detection complexity)
- **Anti-cheat detection**: Scans for `ClientExtensions.dll` and enables enhanced stealth mode when detected
- **User-controlled timing**: Prompts user to ensure they're in-game world before proceeding with injection
- **Immediate initialization**: Clean, direct initialization path without detection overhead

### **2. Advanced Injection Methods**
- **Manual Mapping**: Primary injection method that avoids `CreateRemoteThread` detection
- **Thread Hijacking**: Alternative execution method using existing process threads
- **Traditional Fallback**: `CreateRemoteThread` + `LoadLibraryW` as backup method
- **Method Selection**: Automatically tries most stealthy method first, falls back if needed

### **3. String Obfuscation & Static Analysis Evasion**
- **XOR encryption**: Process names and DLL paths encrypted with key `0x42`
- **Runtime decryption**: Strings only decrypted when needed, then discarded
- **No plaintext artifacts**: Static analysis reveals no obvious target information
- **Obfuscated constants**:
  ```cpp
  ENCRYPTED_PROCESS_NAME_1 = {0x16, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x6a, 0x65, 0x63, 0x74, 0x20, 0x27, 0x70, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x68, 0x2e, 0x65, 0x78, 0x65} // "Project Epoch.exe"
  ENCRYPTED_PROCESS_NAME_2 = {0x01, 0x73, 0x63, 0x65, 0x6e, 0x73, 0x69, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x2e, 0x65, 0x78, 0x65} // "ascension.exe"
  ENCRYPTED_DLL_NAME = {0x0b, 0x77, 0x65, 0x73, 0x6f, 0x6d, 0x65, 0x37, 0x6f, 0x74, 0x6c, 0x6b, 0x2c, 0x69, 0x62, 0x2e, 0x64, 0x6c, 0x6c}
  ```

### **4. Advanced Anti-Cheat Sandboxing & Evasion**
- **ClientExtensions.dll detection**: Identifies the anti-cheat component and enables enhanced stealth mode
- **Comprehensive module hiding**: Intercepts multiple APIs to completely hide our presence:
  - `GetModuleHandle()` and `GetModuleHandleW()` return null for our DLL
  - `EnumProcessModules()` removes our module from enumeration results
  - `GetModuleInformation()` fails when querying our module info
  - `GetModuleFileName()` hides our DLL path and filename
- **PE header obfuscation**: XOR-encrypts our PE header to break signature detection
- **Thread concealment**: Hides our worker threads from thread enumeration
- **Memory region hiding**: Obscures our memory allocations from scanning
- **API call interception**: Comprehensive hooking of detection APIs used by anti-cheat systems
- **Debugger detection**: `IsDebuggerPresent()` and `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent()` checks
- **Analysis tool detection**: Scans for common reverse engineering tools:
  - Process Monitor (`procmon.exe`)
  - Process Explorer (`procexp.exe`) 
  - Wireshark (`wireshark.exe`)
  - IDA Pro (`ida.exe`)
  - OllyDbg (`ollydbg.exe`)
  - x32/x64dbg (`x32dbg.exe`, `x64dbg.exe`)
  - Cheat Engine (`cheatengine-x86_64.exe`)

### **5. Two-Stage DLL Initialization**
- **Stage 1 (Immediate)**: Minimal setup on DLL load
  - Only establishes basic hooks and stealth measures
  - No suspicious immediate initialization behavior
  - Prepares injection infrastructure

- **Stage 2 (User-triggered)**: Full activation when user is ready
  - Activates when user confirms they're in-world and ready
  - Immediately initializes all modules and hooks
  - Performs final environment safety checks and stealth activation

### **6. Memory Access & Trace Cleanup**
- **Minimal privileges**: Uses only necessary process access rights for each phase
- **Instruction cache flushing**: `FlushInstructionCache()` removes injection artifacts
- **Memory cleanup**: Properly frees allocated buffers and closes handles
- **Process handle management**: Separate handles for scanning vs injection phases

## üõ°Ô∏è Injection Flow Sequence

```
1. Environment Check ‚Üí Verify no debuggers/analysis tools
2. String Decryption ‚Üí Decrypt target process name  
3. Process Location ‚Üí Find target using encrypted strings
4. User Confirmation ‚Üí Wait for user to confirm ready and in-world
5. Stealth Injection ‚Üí Manual mapping or traditional injection methods
6. Trace Cleanup ‚Üí Flush caches and free injection artifacts
7. DLL Stage 1 ‚Üí Basic hooks and stealth measures setup
8. DLL Stage 2 ‚Üí Immediate full initialization when user triggered
```

## üéØ Detection Evasion Strategies

### **Behavioral Evasion**
- **No startup injection**: Waits for active gameplay state
- **Randomized timing**: Eliminates predictable behavioral patterns  
- **Delayed hooking**: Avoids immediate suspicious API modifications
- **Natural injection points**: Only injects during normal game operation

### **Static Analysis Evasion**
- **String encryption**: No plaintext process names or paths
- **Obfuscated constants**: Critical data hidden in encrypted arrays
- **Dynamic resolution**: Target information resolved at runtime only

### **Runtime Analysis Evasion**  
- **Environment detection**: Identifies and avoids analysis environments
- **Debugger checks**: Multiple detection methods for attached debuggers
- **Anti-cheat sandboxing**: Hooks APIs to hide from ClientExtensions.dll detection
- **Module enumeration hiding**: Intercepts and filters module listing calls
- **API call interception**: Redirects detection attempts away from our DLL
- **Tool scanning**: Process enumeration for common RE tools
- **Memory cleanup**: Removes injection traces post-operation

## üöÄ Recent Enhancements
