# Advanced Anti-Detection Injection System

This project implements sophisticated stealth injection techniques designed to avoid common detection methods used by anti-cheat systems and security monitoring tools. The system employs multiple layers of evasion techniques for educational cybersecurity research.

## üîí Core Anti-Detection Features

### **1. Multi-Target World-State Aware Injection**
- **Dual process support**: Automatically detects and injects into either `Project Epoch.exe` or `ascension.exe`
- **Pre-injection scanning**: Monitors target process memory for world-state indicators
- **Smart timing**: Only injects after character has fully entered the game world
- **Memory pattern analysis**: Scans multiple addresses (`0x00B4A000`, `0x00C5D000`, `0x00D3F000`) for in-world flags
- **Timeout protection**: Aborts after 5 minutes if world entry is not detected

### **2. Dynamic Timing Randomization**
- **Variable polling intervals**: 1-3 second randomized delays between world state checks  
- **Post-detection delay**: 1 second pause after world entry detection
- **Non-predictable patterns**: Polling timing uses cryptographically secure random generation

### **3. String Obfuscation & Static Analysis Evasion**
- **XOR encryption**: Process names and DLL paths encrypted with key `0x42`
- **Runtime decryption**: Strings only decrypted when needed, then discarded
- **No plaintext artifacts**: Static analysis reveals no obvious target information
- **Obfuscated constants**:
  ```cpp
  ENCRYPTED_PROCESS_NAME_1 = {0x16, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x6a, 0x65, 0x63, 0x74, 0x20, 0x27, 0x70, 0x6f, 0x63, 0x68, 0x2e, 0x65, 0x78, 0x65} // "Project Epoch.exe"
  ENCRYPTED_PROCESS_NAME_2 = {0x01, 0x73, 0x63, 0x65, 0x6e, 0x73, 0x69, 0x6f, 0x6e, 0x2e, 0x65, 0x78, 0x65} // "ascension.exe"
  ENCRYPTED_DLL_NAME = {0x0b, 0x77, 0x65, 0x73, 0x6f, 0x6d, 0x65, 0x37, 0x6f, 0x74, 0x6c, 0x6b, 0x2c, 0x69, 0x62, 0x2e, 0x64, 0x6c, 0x6c}
  ```

### **4. Advanced Anti-Cheat Sandboxing & Evasion**
- **ClientExtensions.dll detection**: Identifies the anti-cheat component and enables enhanced stealth mode
- **Comprehensive module hiding**: Intercepts multiple APIs to completely hide our presence:
  - `GetModuleHandle()` and `GetModuleHandleW()` return null for our DLL
  - `EnumProcessModules()` removes our module from enumeration results
  - `GetModuleInformation()` fails when querying our module info
  - `GetModuleFileName()` hides our DLL path and filename
- **PE header obfuscation**: XOR-encrypts our PE header to break signature detection
- **Thread concealment**: Hides our worker threads from thread enumeration
- **Memory region hiding**: Obscures our memory allocations from scanning
- **API call interception**: Comprehensive hooking of detection APIs used by anti-cheat systems
- **Debugger detection**: `IsDebuggerPresent()` and `CheckRemoteDebuggerPresent()` checks
- **Analysis tool detection**: Scans for common reverse engineering tools:
  - Process Monitor (`procmon.exe`)
  - Process Explorer (`procexp.exe`) 
  - Wireshark (`wireshark.exe`)
  - IDA Pro (`ida.exe`)
  - OllyDbg (`ollydbg.exe`)
  - x32/x64dbg (`x32dbg.exe`, `x64dbg.exe`)
  - Cheat Engine (`cheatengine-x86_64.exe`)

### **5. Two-Stage DLL Initialization**
- **Stage 1 (Immediate)**: Minimal setup on DLL load
  - Only establishes world-state monitoring hooks
  - No suspicious immediate initialization behavior
  - Sets up `Hooks::IsInWorld()` detection capability

- **Stage 2 (Delayed)**: Full activation after world entry
  - Continuously polls world state until character is in-world
  - Immediately initializes all modules and hooks once world detected
  - Performs final environment safety checks

### **6. Memory Access & Trace Cleanup**
- **Minimal privileges**: Uses only necessary process access rights for each phase
- **Instruction cache flushing**: `FlushInstructionCache()` removes injection artifacts
- **Memory cleanup**: Properly frees allocated buffers and closes handles
- **Process handle management**: Separate handles for scanning vs injection phases

## üõ°Ô∏è Injection Flow Sequence

```
1. Environment Check ‚Üí Verify no debuggers/analysis tools
2. String Decryption ‚Üí Decrypt target process name  
3. Process Location ‚Üí Find target using encrypted strings
4. Memory Scanning ‚Üí Read world state from multiple addresses
5. World State Wait ‚Üí Poll until character enters world (5min timeout)
6. Brief Delay ‚Üí Apply 1 second pause after world detection
7. Stealth Injection ‚Üí Minimal privilege CreateRemoteThread injection
8. Trace Cleanup ‚Üí Flush caches and free injection artifacts
9. DLL Stage 1 ‚Üí Basic world monitoring setup only
10. DLL Stage 2 ‚Üí Immediate full initialization once world detected
```

## üéØ Detection Evasion Strategies

### **Behavioral Evasion**
- **No startup injection**: Waits for active gameplay state
- **Randomized timing**: Eliminates predictable behavioral patterns  
- **Delayed hooking**: Avoids immediate suspicious API modifications
- **Natural injection points**: Only injects during normal game operation

### **Static Analysis Evasion**
- **String encryption**: No plaintext process names or paths
- **Obfuscated constants**: Critical data hidden in encrypted arrays
- **Dynamic resolution**: Target information resolved at runtime only

### **Runtime Analysis Evasion**  
- **Environment detection**: Identifies and avoids analysis environments
- **Debugger checks**: Multiple detection methods for attached debuggers
- **Anti-cheat sandboxing**: Hooks APIs to hide from ClientExtensions.dll detection
- **Module enumeration hiding**: Intercepts and filters module listing calls
- **API call interception**: Redirects detection attempts away from our DLL
- **Tool scanning**: Process enumeration for common RE tools
- **Memory cleanup**: Removes injection traces post-operation

## üöÄ Recent Enhancements

### New Anti-Detection Components (v2.0)

- **Manual Mapper**: Alternative injection method avoiding CreateRemoteThread with thread hijacking and APC injection
- **Enhanced Environment Checks**: Multi-layered VM/sandbox/debugger detection with adaptive responses
- **Advanced API Hooking**: Lower-level hooks for better anti-cheat evasion
