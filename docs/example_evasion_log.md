# Example Evasion Technique Logging Output

This shows what you'll see when the injection system runs with the new logging enabled.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Console Output Example**

## üéØ **What Each Status Means**

### **‚úÖ SUCCESS Messages**
- **ETW Patching**: Windows event tracing successfully disabled
- **AMSI Bypass**: Antimalware scanning interface bypassed
- **Syscall Evasion**: Direct kernel calls working
- **Stack Spoofing**: Return addresses successfully hidden
- **Manual Mapping**: Stealthier injection method working

### **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING Messages**  
- **AMSI Not Loaded**: Not an error - means AMSI isn't present to bypass
- **ETW Failed**: Event tracing still active - less stealthy but functional
- **Syscall Failed**: Using normal APIs instead of direct syscalls
- **Breakpoints Detected**: Debugger detected but cleared

### **‚ùå ERROR Messages**
- **Memory Protection Failed**: Can't modify system functions (permissions/AV blocking)
- **Function Not Found**: API not available on this Windows version
- **File Access Failed**: DLL file issues or permissions

## üîß **Stealth Rating Scale**

| Success Rate | Status | Description |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| 90%+ | üéØ ELITE STEALTH | Maximum evasion - very hard to detect |
| 75-89% | üõ°Ô∏è HIGH STEALTH | Good evasion - most tools fooled |
| 50-74% | ‚ö° MODERATE STEALTH | Some evasion - basic protection |
| <50% | ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW STEALTH | Minimal evasion - easily detected |

## üìù **Log File Output** (Optional)

If file logging is enabled, you'll also get a log file in your temp directory:

```
=== NEW SESSION 20:15:32 ===
[20:15:32.123] [SUCCESS] [INIT] Evasion Manager initialized - starting technique deployment
[20:15:32.125] [DEBUG] [ETW] Found EtwEventWrite at 0x7FFE12345678
[20:15:32.127] [SUCCESS] [ETW] Successfully patched EtwEventWrite - Windows event tracing disabled
... (same format as console)
```

## üêõ **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **"ETW patching failed"**
- **Cause**: Antivirus blocking memory modification
- **Impact**: Event tracing still works (less stealth)
- **Solution**: Run as administrator or disable real-time protection

### **"AMSI bypass failed"**
- **Cause**: Windows Defender blocking AMSI modification  
- **Impact**: Payloads may trigger antimalware alerts
- **Solution**: Use different bypass technique or disable Windows Defender

### **"Syscall evasion failed"**
- **Cause**: Windows version incompatibility
- **Impact**: Uses normal APIs (detectable by advanced tools)
- **Solution**: Update syscall numbers for your Windows version

### **"Manual mapping failed"**
- **Cause**: DLL file access issues or PE parsing failure
- **Impact**: Falls back to CreateRemoteThread (more detectable)
- **Solution**: Check file permissions and DLL validity

## üéØ **Next Steps**

When you see the logging output, you'll know exactly:

1. **Which techniques are working** ‚úÖ
2. **Which ones failed and why** ‚ùå  
3. **Your overall stealth level** üìä
4. **Whether to proceed or fix issues** üîß

The injection will continue even if some techniques fail, but you'll have full visibility into what's happening under the hood!
