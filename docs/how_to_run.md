# How to Run the Injector (With Full Logging)

## üéØ **Best Method: Use the Batch Scripts**

I've created two batch scripts to make running the injector easy and give you full visibility of the logs:

### **Option 1: Simple Run (`run_injector.bat`)**
- **Right-click ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"**
- Checks if game is running
- Shows basic status and logs
- Good for normal usage

### **Option 2: Debug Mode (`run_with_logging.bat`)**  
- **Right-click ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"**
- Full debug logging with colors
- Saves logs to files for later analysis
- Best for troubleshooting

## üìã **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **1. Build the Project First**
```bash
mkdir build
cd build  
cmake ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

### **2. Copy Files to Root**
Copy these files from `build/Release/` to your project root:
- `AwesomeWotlkInjector.exe`
- `AwesomeWotlkLib.dll`

Your folder should look like:
```
awesome_woltk_injection/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AwesomeWotlkInjector.exe    ‚Üê From build
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AwesomeWotlkLib.dll         ‚Üê From build  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_injector.bat            ‚Üê I created this
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_with_logging.bat        ‚Üê I created this
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### **3. Start Your Game**
- Launch `Project Epoch.exe` or `ascension.exe`
- **Log in completely and enter the game world**
- Stay in-game (not at character select screen)

### **4. Run the Injector**

#### **For Normal Use:**
1. **Right-click** `run_injector.bat`
2. Select **"Run as Administrator"**
3. Follow the prompts

#### **For Debug/Troubleshooting:**
1. **Right-click** `run_with_logging.bat`  
2. Select **"Run as Administrator"**
3. Watch the detailed colored output

## üñ•Ô∏è **What You'll See**

### **Batch Script Output:**
```
================================================
   AWESOME WOTLK INJECTION SYSTEM

### **Then the Evasion Logs:**
```

## üêõ **If Something Goes Wrong**

### **"Process not found"**
```
[ERROR] No target game process found!
[ERROR] Please start Project Epoch.exe or ascension.exe first
[ERROR] Make sure you're logged in and in the game world
```
**Solution**: Start the game first, log in completely

### **"Not running as Administrator"**
```
[WARNING] Not running as Administrator
[WARNING] Some evasion techniques may fail
```
**Solution**: Right-click the .bat file ‚Üí "Run as Administrator"

### **Evasion Technique Failures**
```
[ERROR] [ETW] Failed to change memory protection for EtwEventWrite
[ERROR] [AMSI] Failed to find AmsiScanBuffer function
```
**Solution**: Check Windows Defender, try disabling real-time protection temporarily

## üéØ **Why This Method is Best**

1. **Full Visibility** - See every step of the injection process
2. **Color-Coded Logs** - Easy to spot successes/failures  
3. **Admin Check** - Warns you if you need higher privileges
4. **Process Detection** - Confirms game is running before injecting
5. **Error Handling** - Clear error messages with solutions
6. **Log Files** - Debug mode saves everything for later analysis

## üîÑ **Alternative: Manual Command Prompt**

If you prefer running manually:

```bash
# Open Command Prompt as Administrator
# Navigate to your project folder
cd C:\path\to\your\awesome_woltk_injection

# Run the injector
AwesomeWotlkInjector.exe

# Keep the window open to see logs
pause
```

But the batch scripts are much more user-friendly and give better feedback!
